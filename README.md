# Research Proposal: Predicting Fraud in Financial Payments
### By Avi Gadde and Nico Schuster

## Research Question

For this project, we want to create a predictive model to detect fraud in financial service payments and transfers. Currently, there are many hurdles when it comes to fraud detection; many of the predictors are fallible and don't correctly predict whether a payment is actually fraudelent or not. The goal of this project will be to train several different machine learning models to detect fraud given the attributes: payment_type, amount, nameOrig, oldBalanceOrig, namedDest, isFlaggedFraud, isFraud, among others. 


What do we want to know or what problems are we trying to solve? As in the midterm, you should list (1) the “bigger” question/debate/problem you’re interested in, and also (2) the specific research question(s) you’ll actually try to answer.

The research question will be smaller in scope than the big picture question. But the answer to your specific research question should shed light on the bigger question (although it likely won’t conclusively answer it).

The answer to your specific research question should shed light on the bigger question (although it likely won’t conclusively answer it).

If your project is about relationships, what are the hypotheses you’re testing?

If your project is about prediction, what is your metrics of success? (What are you maximizing?) Can you find a baseline from prior work to give you a ball park to aim for?

Necessary Data¶
This section should cover:

What does the final dataset need to look like (mostly dictated by the question and the availability of data):

What is an observation, e.g. a firm, or a firm-year, etc.

What is the sample period?

What are the sample conditions? (Years, restrictions you anticipate (e.g. exclude or require some industries)

What variables are absolutely necessary and what would you like to have if possible?

What data do we have and what data do we need?

How will we collect more data?

What are the raw inputs and how will you store them (the folder structure(s) for each input type)?

Speculate at a high level (not specific code!) about how you’ll transform the raw data into the final form.
