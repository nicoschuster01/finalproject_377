## Research Question

For this project, we want to create a predictive model to detect fraud in financial service payments and transfers. Currently, there are many hurdles when it comes to fraud detection; many of the predictors are fallible and don't correctly predict whether a payment is actually fraudelent or not. The goal of this project will be to train several different machine learning models to detect fraud given the attributes: payment_type, amount, nameOrig, oldBalanceOrig, namedDest, isFlaggedFraud, isFraud, among others.

The problem we are trying to solve is being able to identify fraudulent financial transactions in an efficient manner.

We would like to do this by identifying the necessary components of the dataset that we have obtained of prior fraudelent financial transactions and then developing a machine learning model to be able to predict fraudulent transactions that could happen in the future.

## Necessary Data¶

This section should cover:

What does the final dataset need to look like (mostly dictated by the question and the availability of data):

What is an observation, e.g. a firm, or a firm-year, etc.

What is the sample period?

What are the sample conditions? (Years, restrictions you anticipate (e.g. exclude or require some industries)

What variables are absolutely necessary and what would you like to have if possible?

What data do we have and what data do we need?

How will we collect more data?

What are the raw inputs and how will you store them (the folder structure(s) for each input type)?

Speculate at a high level (not specific code!) about how you’ll transform the raw data into the final form.
