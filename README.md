# Research Proposal: Predicting Fraud in Financial Transactions
### By Avi Gadde and Nico Schuster

## Research Question

For this project, we want to create a predictive model to detect fraud in financial service payments and transfers. Currently, there are many hurdles when it comes to fraud detection; many of the predictors are fallible and don't correctly predict whether a payment is actually fraudelent or not. The goal of this project will be to train several different machine learning models to detect fraud given the attributes: payment_type, amount, nameOrig, oldBalanceOrig, namedDest, isFlaggedFraud, isFraud, among others. 

## Necessary Data¶

#### Data Collection

What data do we have and what data do we need?

How will we collect more data?

What does the final dataset need to look like (mostly dictated by the question and the availability of data):

#### About the Dataset

What is an observation, e.g. a firm, or a firm-year, etc.

What is the sample period?

What are the sample conditions? (Years, restrictions you anticipate (e.g. exclude or require some industries)

What variables are absolutely necessary and what would you like to have if possible?

What are the raw inputs and how will you store them (the folder structure(s) for each input type)?

#### Speculation

Speculate at a high level (not specific code!) about how you’ll transform the raw data into the final form.
